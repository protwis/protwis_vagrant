About GPCRdb
============

GPCRdb offers reference data and easy-to-use web tools and diagrams for a multidisciplinary audience investigating GPCR
function, drug design or evolution. It stores a manual annotation of all GPCR crystal structures, the largest
collections of receptor mutants and reference sequence alignments. The tools run directly in the web browser allowing
for swift analysis of structures, sequence similarities, receptor relationships, and ligand target profiles. Diagrams
illustrate receptor sequences (snake-plot and helix box diagrams) and relationships (phylogenetic trees). A visual
overview can be seen in the `GPCRdb poster`_.

Background and development
--------------------------
The GPCR database, GPCRdb was started in 1993 by Gert Vriend, Ad IJzerman, Bob Bywater and Friedrich Rippmann. Over
two decades, GPCRdb evolved to be a comprehensive information system storing and analysing data. In 2013, the
stewardship of GPCRdb was transferred to the `David Gloriam group`_ at the University of Copenhagen, backed up by an
international team of contributors and developers from the EU COST Action ‘`GLISTEN`_’.
