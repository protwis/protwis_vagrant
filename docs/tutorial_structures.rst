Structure statistics
--------------------

This video demonstrates how to view statistics based on available structure data in GPCRdb.

* The statistics are automatically generated, and always reflect the lates version of the database.

* By moving the pointer over the plot, more information can be displayed.

* All plots can be downloaded.

Question
^^^^^^^^

* How many structures were published in 2014?

Structure browser
-----------------

This video demonstrates how to use the structure browser to gain an overview of the available structure data in GPCRdb.

* The structure data is displayed in a table format.

* The table can be filtered and sorted on any column.

* The "Show representative" button shows only one selected structure for each protein.

* To use the "Superpose structures" button, first select (check box) structures to superpose, and highlight (click on
  the row) the reference structure (the selected structure will be superposed on this structure).

* To use the "Download" and "Align" buttons, first select (tick box) structures to download or align.

Question
^^^^^^^^

How many structures from Class B are available?

Structure superposition
-----------------------

The following three videos demonstrate how to superpose structures in GPCRdb.

Example 1
^^^^^^^^^

* Only one structure can be selected as a reference, and all selected structures will be superposed on this structure.

* It is possible to select many structures to superpose using the "Structure(s) to superpose" button (hold down
  Control on Windows/Linux and Command on Mac while selecting).

* It is possible to select which parts of the sequence (e.g. all TMs or only TM5) to superpose on.

* After the structures have been superposed, you can download the full structures, or only a specific part of the
  sequence (e.g. TM5). In this video, the user downloads the full structure.

Example 2
^^^^^^^^^

* Only one structure can be selected as a reference, and all selected structures will be superposed on this structure.

* It is possible to select many structures to superpose using the "Structure(s) to superpose" button (hold down
  Control on Windows/Linux and Command on Mac while selecting).

* It is possible to select which parts of the sequence (e.g. all TMs or only TM5) to superpose on.

* After the structures have been superposed, you can download the full structures, or only a specific part of the
  sequence (e.g. TM5). In this video, the user downloads only a part of the sequence.

Example 3
^^^^^^^^^

* It is also possible to select structures to superpose from the structure browser.

* First select the structures that should be superposed using the check boxes to the left of each row.

* To select the reference structure, hightlight it by click anywhere on its row (it turns blue).

* Click "Superpose structures" and continue the superposition workflow as before.

Generic numbering of PDB files
------------------------------

This video demonstrates how to add generic residue numbers to a PDB file using GPCRdb, and visualize the numbers in
PyMOL.

* Upload any PDB file (also homology models).

* It is possible to download the full structure, or subset of its sequence.

* On the results page, download the PyMOL visualization script at the bottom of the page.

* Load the downloaded PDB file into PyMOL.

* Drag the downloaded script file onto the PyMOL window.

* Press F2 to view the generic residue numbers (F1 removes the numbers again).
