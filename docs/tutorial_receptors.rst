Receptors and sequences
=======================

Receptors pages
---------------

This video demonstrates how to use the receptor pages.

* By moving the pointer over residues in the sequence viewer, more information can be displayed.

* Snake and Helix box plots can be custom colored and downloaded.

* A summary of available mutant data is displayed, and a link provided for further analysis.

* Available structure information is listed.

Questions
^^^^^^^^^

* Look up the receptor page for the beta1-adrenoceptor. How many mutations are there available?

* Look up the receptor page for your favorite GPCR. Is there any data available?


Structure-based sequence alignments
-----------------------------------

This video demonstrates how to build a structure-based sequence alignment.

* Any combination of receptors and/or receptor families can be selected.

* It is possible to limit the alignment to a particular part of the sequence, e.g. TM6.

* By moving the pointer over residues in the alignment, more information can be displayed.

* A consensus sequence (color coded by conservation) is displayed below the alignment.

* Statistics on residue and residue property conservation is displayed below the consensus sequence.

Question
^^^^^^^^

* Create an alignment of TM5 for all Class A peptide receptors. How well conserved is position 5.50?


Similarity search
-----------------

This video demonstrates how to perform similarity search with a reference receptor.

* Only one receptor can be selected as reference, and the other selected receptors will be compared to the reference.

* It is possible to limit the search to a particular part of the sequence, e.g. TM6.

* In the resulting sequence alignment, the sequences are ranked by similarity to the reference, and their similarity
  scores are shown to the right of the receptor name.

Question
^^^^^^^^

* Look up the similarity of the FFA1 receptor against Class A lipid receptors using the 7TMs.
  Which receptor is most similar?
