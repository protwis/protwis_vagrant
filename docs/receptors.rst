Receptors and families
======================

The selection page allows users to find a receptor and family by searching or browsing.

The search box displays a list of both families and receptors that match the input keyword. Selecting either a receptor
or family will take you to the corresponding receptor/family page.

The browser displays a hierarchical view of the families, and the proteins in each family. Selecting either a receptor
or family will take you to the corresponding receptor/family page.

Receptor pages
--------------

The page displays basic information about the selected protein and a sequence viewer, as well as helix box and snake
diagrams. The diagrams can be colored by properties, mutant information, or ligand interactions extracted from
structures.

Family pages
------------

The family pages resemble the protein pages, but the sequence shown on a family page is a consensus sequence for the
human sequences in the family.
