As a programmer
---------------

We use languages/tools such as Python, Javascript, Django, PostgreSQL, and Git to build GPCRdb. Prior knowledge of
these tools is helpful, but not necessary.

As a data curator
-----------------

Data curation tasks involve e.g. sequence alignments, analysis of protein structures and collection of mutation data.
