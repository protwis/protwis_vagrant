Mutations
==========

Mutation browser
----------------

This video demonstrates how use the mutation browser to search for and visualize mutations for a family of receptors.

* It is possible to limit the search to a particular part of the sequence, e.g. TM6.

* The mutations are listed in table format, and it is possible to filter and order interactions by the values in
  each column.

* By moving the pointer to a ligand name or reference, more details can be shown.

* Snake and Helix box plots highlighting the mutated residues can be downloaded. The mutated residues are colored on
  a green-yellow-red scale according to effect on ligand binding.
